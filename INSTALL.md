Create a webhook in either a fork or a upstream repository. (Settings => Webhooks & Services => Add Webhook)
Add http://backstroke.us as the payload url.
Push some code to the upstream repository to see Backstroke in action.

If youre not the maintainer, you would need to convince the maintainer of the upstream repo (the one you have forked) to register that backstroke webhook.
You will see PR (pull requests) appear automatically on your fork, for you to accept (keeping you in sync with any evolution done on the original repo side).
