# Contributing to Backstroke

## What is "open work"?
At http://gratipay.com/about, they have a definition:

> “Open work” means that your company or organization makes it easy for any individual to do your work for you without asking you first, and as a result to share in any revenue you generate. 

Do work first, ask permission later. Fun, isn't it? If you are opening a new issue or submitting a pull request, **go for it!** Don't be afraid that it's a dumb idea or a duplicate of another issue or an unwanted change or whatever. Maybe it is! We're still glad to have you! :^)
